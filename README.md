This ia a web project taking amazon website as our reference. Here our main motive is to add the comparision extension to the website which is the unique and key to the project. Here we have three different categories namely New arrivals, second hand, and rentals. on clicking on a product we see a price and the user is able to compare and view the prices in different categories for the same product. Rest of the features are similar to any other ecommerce website like sign up, sign in. And adding to cart reviewing the products and buying them.
